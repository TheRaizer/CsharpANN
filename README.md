# C# ANN

Basic Artificial Neural network with no use of Machine learning libraries.
This code will help you get a good understanding of how a ANN works at a fundamental level.

Attempted image classification. However with the limitations of programming the network manually
with no libraries as well as having no vectorization, training took far too long. Due to this
the accuracy was never quite good enough falling around the ranges of 68.75% to 53%.
With certain hyperparameters the network would also overfit with a 90% accuracy on training set and 
50%-53% accuracy on test set. For now I have not implemented any regularization techniques 
to stop overfitting.
